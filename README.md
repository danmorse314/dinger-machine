An app to test whether any batted ball would've been a homer in another park.

Updated with all batted balls that traveled at least 300 feet, the day after the game.

Ever see a deep fly ball that doesn't quite make it over the 25ft wall in dead center of Chase Field and think, _that would have been a homer if we weren't playing in this stadium_? Or maybe it's a line drive that taps the upper quarter of the green monster at Fenway Park, or this 425 ft double from Kyle Seager:

"Boy, that would be two home runs here [for Seager], at T-Mobile Park," says Dave Sims, referencing the triple Seager hit in nearly the exact same spot, but 20 ft shorter, just three innings earlier. He's correct of course, and it's fairly easy to see considering the double at Fenway hit the wall right above the 420 ft mark, and the deepest part of center field at T-Mobile is listed as 401 ft.
